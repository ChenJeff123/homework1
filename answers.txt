What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Merge will combine changes made by two parent branches. The commit history for both parents will be preserved.
Rebase will combine changes made by both branches but will insert the commit history of one of the branches into the other branch.
Essentially, merge preserve all history by both branches, while rebase will change it into a single continuous commit history.
